# Overview:
This is a project that I worked on with my dad to create a custom Settlers Of
Catan playing board that uses LEDs to indicate what resources are spawned where
eliminating the majority of the setup for the game.

**Note:** These are living documents and may be updated at any time without any
notice.

# Steps:
Currently don't exist. They may exist in the future, who knows.

# Misc Notes:
  - When soldering the LEDs together, remove the glue from the back of them if
  they came with any on the back. This is because when they are soldered the
  heat from the soldering iron causes the glue to melt and prevents a complete
  connection between the wire and the LED.
